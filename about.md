This is Sourav. 
Here are some scattered thoughts on statistics, Machine Learning and everything in between.

I am a data scientist at a large Bay area company. In general, I am interested in Probabilistic Machine Learning, Bayesian Models, Spatial Statistics.

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions/comments.

You can find the me in Twitter: [@souravc83](https://twitter.com/souravc83). DMs are open.

I made this blog with Jekyll, github pages, and by using a [script](https://github.com/souravc83/souravc83.github.io/blob/master/notebooks/notebook_convert.py) to convert jupyter notebooks to html. The script and theme are largely borrowed from [here](https://peterroelants.github.io/).
